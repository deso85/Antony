# Antony - Discord Bot
Antony is yet another Discord Bot which provides well known functions as well as some specialized functions for our German ant keeping Discord Server. I decided to code it in Java as I have basic knowledge of this programming language. Thanks to [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)!
